# MyScriptDebugProject
This is a iOS project that was built to prove that MyScript v2.1.1 SDK crashes without any noticeable reason.

Clone the repo, install CocoaPods using `pod install` and then run the app using Xcode.

Then write something using Apple Pencil and tap on Modal in top left corner. Modal screen should show containing MyScript editor in the left and UITextView in the right.

Tap on Cancel and the app should crash.
